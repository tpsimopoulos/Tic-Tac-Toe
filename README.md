This repository contains several different implementations of Tic-tac-toe.

**Single Player vs AI** - Allows human player or random computer player to play against an AI      using the minimax algorithm to determine each of its turns so that at worst the game turns out to be a tie and at best it wins every time.

**Single Player vs Random Computer** - Allows a human player to play against a computer player that selects a random available move each time.

**Two Player** - Allows two human players to play against each other.
